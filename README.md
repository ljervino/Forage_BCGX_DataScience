# Forage_BCGX_DataScience
 Customer churn exercise from forage job simulation
## Project Overview

This project involves data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to understand and predict customer churn. The project is divided into three main stages:

1. **Data Understanding**: Initial exploration and analysis of the data to understand its structure and key characteristics.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to improve the predictive power of the model.
3. **Prediction**: Building and evaluating a predictive model to forecast customer churn.
